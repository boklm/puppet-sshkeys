sshkeys puppet module
=====================

The sshkeys puppet module allow the creation and installation of ssh keys.


How it works
============

With the sshkeys module, you define a key that will be generated on the
puppet master. You define where this key should be installed, for the
client key pair, and for the authorized_keys.

When the key has not been generated yet, you may need to run puppet
twice. The key will be generated on the first run, and installed on the
second run.

It is also possible to configure pre-defined ssh keys by passing them as 
parameters to the main class.

Usage
=====

In order to tell which node will generate the keys, you need to include
the `sshkeys::keymaster` class on the puppet master node::

  include sshkeys::keymaster

Before installing the key, we need to create it. This is done with the
`create_key` ressource, on the puppet master node. We can create the key
`key1`::

  sshkeys::create_key{key1: }

If we want to install the `key1` key pair for user `user1`, we can use
the `set_client_key_pair` ressource::

  sshkeys::set_client_key_pair{'key1-for-user1':
    keyname => 'key1',
    home => '/home/user1',
    user => 'user1',
  }

The `key1` private and public keys should now be installed for user
`user1` on the node on which we created this ressource.

If we want to allow the key `key1` to connect to the `user2` account,
we use the `set_authorized_keys` ressource::

  sshkeys::set_authorized_keys{'key1-to-user2':
    keyname => 'key1',
    user => 'user2',
    home => '/home/user2',
  }

Now, `user1` should have the `key1` key pair installed on his account,
and be able to login to the `user2` account.

Pre-defined keys
================

This is best done using Hiera. 

Parametrizing the sshkeys class in Hiera::

  sshkeys::manual_keys:
    just_a_name:
        user: odie
        key: jon@jukebox

This will fetch the (rsa, by default) key named "jon@jukebox" from hiera, and
install it in the authorized_keys file of the user "odie" on every node that
this hiera yaml file applies to. The name "just_a_name" is arbitrary.

It is easiest to put::

  jon@jukebox: "AAAa254BCDCBCC...poiuyt" 

(without key types and all that) in hiera at the top level, so you can use them
anywhere in your hierarchy.
